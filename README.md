# not-that-annoying-hipchat

This is a tampermonkey script for chrome. 

This script

* removes the message count from the room name list and replaces them with an underline on the room name. 
* replaces the message count favicon with a favicon


Todos:

  * Make the room header to be one line and smaller

I advise you to set the zoom to 90% because the stuff in this new style is BIG.
